# Engineering Handbook: agent index

This folder holds the engineering handbook. Projects use it through the `handbook` Claude Code plugin ([SETUP.md](SETUP.md)): the developer runs `/handbook:rules`, which loads only the sections a task needs. It has two kinds of files:

- `best-practices/`: the engineering rules, one technology per file, written as MUST / SHOULD / MAY rules.
- `guides/`: short process references, such as going from an idea to a feature list or choosing code quality tools. They have no rule keywords.

This index tells you which file to read for a task and how to read the rules.

**Paths in this file are relative to this file's folder.** If this file was imported from a host project, open the handbook files from the folder this file lives in.

## How to use these files

1. Find your task in the routing table below and open only the files it lists. Don't load every file: together they are about 270k tokens.
2. In each best-practices file, read **Key rules** first, then only the numbered sections you need. Guides have no Key rules: read the sections the table lists.
3. Before you finish, go through the **PR checklist** of every best-practices file you used.

| Commit, branch, PR, release or Git/GitHub workflow | [git.md](best-practices/git.md) Key rules, then the section you need |

## Rule keywords

Every rule starts with one keyword.

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **MUST** / **MUST NOT** | Required or forbidden. Breaking it is a bug or blocks review. |
| **SHOULD** / **SHOULD NOT** | The default. If you deviate, add a one-line code comment saying why (or say why in the PR description if the change isn't tied to one spot). |
| **MAY** | Allowed when it helps; not required. |

Text without a keyword is explanation, not a rule. Steps marked *(human)* need a person, for example testing with a screen reader. An agent should list them for the developer instead of skipping them silently.

## Precedence

When two sources disagree, follow the higher one:

1. **Decisions recorded in the host project**: an ADR, the project's own `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`, or the ticket you are working on.
2. **The more specific file**:
   - shadcn.md over tailwind.md
   - trpc.md over tanstack-query.md and nestjs.md
   - graphql.md over tanstack-query.md and nestjs.md
   - nextjs.md over react.md
   - react.md, nextjs.md, tailwind.md and shadcn.md over ui-ux.md on how to build something in that stack; ui-ux.md stays authoritative on what users see and can do
   - postgresql.md over nestjs.md, python-pydantic.md and typescript.md on database rules
   - sqlalchemy.md over postgresql.md on SQLAlchemy-specific rules (models, sessions, Alembic); postgresql.md stays authoritative on SQL, schema and Postgres itself
   - prisma.md over postgresql.md on Prisma-specific rules (schema, client, migrations); postgresql.md stays authoritative on SQL, schema and Postgres itself
   - drizzle.md over postgresql.md on Drizzle-specific rules (schema, queries, migrations); postgresql.md stays authoritative on SQL, schema and Postgres itself
   - zod.md over typescript.md on the Zod API itself; typescript.md stays authoritative on language and tsconfig rules
   - nestjs.md, trpc.md and nextjs.md over api-design.md
   - nestjs.md, trpc.md and postgresql.md over supertest.md on app wiring and database rules
   - any framework file over typescript.md
3. **The more general file.**
4. **Guides.** Files in `guides/` are reference notes, not rules, so any file in `best-practices/` wins over them. For example, uv's dependency cooldown follows uv.md (7 days), not code-quality.md (3 days).

Two exceptions:
- **API facts:** if the official docs for the installed version disagree with a file about how an API behaves, the docs win. Fix the file in the same PR.
- **tRPC agent skills:** the skills tRPC ships are older than trpc.md, so trpc.md wins over them.

## Runtime baseline

[typescript.md](best-practices/typescript.md) §1 owns the project's Node.js and TypeScript versions. Other files may mention a framework's own minimum versions; those are for information, not the project's target.

## Examples

Code examples use one made-up domain: a project management app with **users**, **projects** and **tasks**. The names (`Task`, `createTaskAction`, `app/(app)/tasks/`) show where code goes; they are not files that already exist in your project. Each example's first comment gives its file path. Blocks marked ❌ show what not to do; never copy them.

## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ADR | Architecture Decision Record: a short document in the project that records a technical decision and why it was made. |
| BOLA | Broken Object Level Authorization: OWASP's name for IDOR in APIs, and the first risk in its API Security Top 10. |
| CORS | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing: browser rules for which other origins may call an API. |
| CSP | Content Security Policy: a response header that limits which scripts, styles and other resources a page may load. |
| CSRF | Cross-Site Request Forgery: another site making a logged-in user's browser send a request. |
| CTE | Common Table Expression: a named subquery written with `WITH` in SQL. |
| DAL | Data Access Layer: the server-only module that every data read and write goes through. It checks auth and returns DTOs. |
| DI | Dependency Injection. |
| DTO | Data Transfer Object: a plain object that holds only the fields the caller is allowed to see. |
| IDOR | Insecure Direct Object Reference: reading or changing another user's record by changing an ID. Prevent it by checking ownership, not only that the user is logged in. |
| ISR | Incremental Static Regeneration: a page rendered ahead of time and refreshed after a set time or on demand. |
| Keyset pagination | Paging by "rows after the last value you saw" (`WHERE (created_at, id) > (:a, :b) ORDER BY ... LIMIT`), instead of `OFFSET`. Stays fast on deep pages. |
| LCP / INP / CLS | Core Web Vitals: Largest Contentful Paint (load speed), Interaction to Next Paint (responsiveness), Cumulative Layout Shift (visual stability). |
| MCP | Model Context Protocol: a standard way to give AI agents tools and data. |
| MVCC | Multiversion Concurrency Control: how PostgreSQL lets readers and writers work at once by keeping several versions of a row. Dead versions are cleaned up by vacuum. |
| N+1 | A query pattern where loading N related rows triggers one query per row (N queries) on top of the original one, instead of a single batched query. |
| OKLCH | A CSS color format (lightness, chroma, hue) that keeps perceived brightness even across colors. |
| ORM | Object-Relational Mapper, such as Prisma, Drizzle or SQLAlchemy. |
| PgBouncer | A connection pooler placed in front of PostgreSQL. In transaction mode it hands each transaction a different server connection, which breaks session state and server-side prepared statements. |
| PITR | Point-In-Time Recovery: restoring a database to any chosen moment, using a base backup plus archived write-ahead logs. |
| Preflight | Tailwind's base reset stylesheet. |
| RLS | Row Level Security: PostgreSQL policies that decide which rows a role can read or change. |
| RSC | React Server Components. |
| RTL | Right-to-left languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew. |
| Savepoint | A named point inside a transaction that can be rolled back to on its own, without undoing the whole transaction (`SAVEPOINT`, or a nested `session.begin_nested()`). |
| SSE | Server-Sent Events: a one-way stream of events from server to browser over HTTP. |
| SSR | Server-Side Rendering. |
| SSRF | Server-Side Request Forgery: tricking a server into fetching a URL the attacker chose, usually to reach internal services or cloud credentials. |
| WAL | Write-Ahead Log: the log PostgreSQL writes before changing data files, used for crash recovery and replication. |
