# Engineering Handbook

Shared engineering knowledge for our projects, written so that both developers and AI coding agents (such as Claude Code) can follow it. It has two parts:

- **Best practices** (`best-practices/`): the rules. Each file covers one technology and uses MUST / SHOULD / MAY rules.
- **Guides** (`guides/`): short process references, such as going from an idea to a feature list or choosing code quality tools.

## Folder structure

```text
AGENTS.md          Index for AI agents: which file to read for a task, rule keywords, precedence, glossary
CLAUDE.md          Imports AGENTS.md for Claude Code (only when you work on this repo)
README.md          This file
SETUP.md           How to install the plugin and set up a project
.claude-plugin/    Plugin and marketplace manifests (plugin "handbook", marketplace "engineering-handbook")
skills/            The plugin's manual-only commands: rules, review, init
best-practices/    One file per technology, written as MUST / SHOULD / MAY rules
guides/            Process references, without rule keywords
scripts/           handbook.py: prints routes, sections and checklists for the commands
                   check_docs.py: checks AGENTS.md routing, section references and links (runs in CI)
```

Guides are reference notes, not rules. When a guide and a best-practices file disagree, the best-practices file wins (see [AGENTS.md § Precedence](AGENTS.md#precedence)).

## Using this repo in a project

This repo is a Claude Code plugin. Its commands are manual only, so nothing from the handbook loads until you type one, and each command loads only the sections a task needs from the files the project uses. Full steps: [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).

```text
/plugin install handbook --marketplace M-Ibrahim-Raza/Engineering-Handbook   once per machine
/handbook:init                                                               once per project: writes .claude/handbook.json
/handbook:rules <task>                                                       load only the rules a task needs, then do it
/handbook:review                                                             check your changes against the PR checklists
```

Don't import `AGENTS.md` or any handbook file into a project's `CLAUDE.md`: that loads it in every session.

To record a project-specific exception, write an ADR or add a note to the project's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`. Project decisions override these files (see [AGENTS.md § Precedence](AGENTS.md#precedence)).

## Reading the rules

Every rule in `best-practices/` starts with a keyword:

| Keyword | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **MUST** / **MUST NOT** | Required or forbidden. Breaking it is a bug or blocks review. |
| **SHOULD** / **SHOULD NOT** | The default. If you deviate, add a one-line code comment saying why (or say why in the PR description if the change isn't tied to one spot). |
| **MAY** | Allowed when it helps; not required. |

Each best-practices file starts with **Key rules** (the 10–15 rules that matter most) and ends with a **PR checklist**. Guides have numbered sections but no keywords, Key rules or PR checklist.

## Contributing

Keep every file of a kind in the same shape so agents and people can find things the same way everywhere. Add every new file to the [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) routing table: `scripts/check_docs.py` fails CI for files that aren't linked there, for files left in the repo root, and for broken relative links.

### Best-practices file template

```markdown
# <Technology> Best Practices

> **Baseline:** <versions this file was checked against>
> **Last researched:** YYYY-MM-DD, from <sources> (see [Sources](#n-sources)).
> **Re-check when:** <technology> ships a new minor version: sections X, Y and Z.
> **Related:** [other.md](other.md) (what it covers), …

## How to use this file
<the shared block: who it's for, the keyword table, the precedence line>

## Key rules
<10–15 most important MUST / MUST NOT rules, each linking to its section>

## Contents
<flat numbered list of sections>

## 1. … numbered sections …

## N. Anti-patterns        (optional; each item uses the same keyword as its rule and links to it)
## N. PR checklist         (only MUST rules; never stricter than the body)
## N. Sources
```

### Guide shape

Guides are short (one to two pages) and use no rule keywords:

```markdown
# <Topic>

<one line: what this guide helps you do>

## 1. Principles that matter most
## 2. … numbered sections …
## N. Anti-patterns
## Sources
```

### Writing rules

These apply to best-practices files. Guides follow only **Write a rule in one file only**.


- **One keyword per bullet.** If a bullet needs a MUST and a SHOULD, split it.
- **Every MUST and MUST NOT gets a reason**, in a `*Why:*` line or in the same sentence.
- **Make rules checkable.** Write a number or a test ("more than 3 props", "any uncached `await`"), not "large", "slow" or "where appropriate".
- **Anchor to versions, not time.** Write "since 4.2" or "as of 2026-10", not "now", "currently", "still", "yet" or "latest".
- **Don't assume project files exist.** Write "if your project has a `data/` folder…" or show where to create a helper before you use it.
- **Mark steps an agent can't do** as *(human)*.
- **Examples:**
  - start with a comment giving the file path (`// app/(app)/tasks/actions.ts`)
  - include the imports they use
  - mark bad code with `❌`
  - use the users / projects / tasks example domain
- **Write a rule in one file only.** If another file needs it, link to the owning file instead of restating it, so the two can't drift apart. A guide links to the best-practices file that owns a rule; it never owns rules itself.
- **Update the header** (Baseline, Last researched) when you re-check a file against new versions.
